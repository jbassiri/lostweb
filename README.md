A Grassroots reference implementation. 

## Background

A grassroots digital system consists of multiple autonomous and independently forming networks that can combine when one member joins multiple networks. This is similar to grassroots movements in the real world. For more background visit here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fmeq7mcf5s0jjlp/Grassroots%20Digital%20Democracy.pdf?dl=0
